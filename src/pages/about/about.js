      <h2>About this Project</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the "Running Man Project"! As an individual passionate about programming, I was inspired by the Korean variety show "Running Man" to create this fun and entertaining web application. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This project aims to bring the laughter and excitement of the Running Man game to your screens. Just like in the show, gather your friends, and get ready for this hilarious and challenging game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this web app, you can enjoy a collection of mini-games, puzzles, and challenges, all designed to make you laugh to tears. It's the perfect way to spend time with friends and create lasting memories together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're a fan of the original show or new to the concept, I hope this Running Man Project brings joy and entertainment to you and your friends. Remember, the most important part is to have fun and enjoy the experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for joining this journey, and I hope you have a fantastic time playing the Running Man games with your friends!
